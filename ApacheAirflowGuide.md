#### 1. Introduction to Apache Airflow  

Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow orchestration tool used to schedule, monitor, and manage complex data workflows. It helps automate ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and other data-related tasks.

##### Key Features of Apache Airflow  
- âœ… **Workflow Automation** â€“ Schedules and manages task execution.  
- âœ… **Scalability** â€“ Handles workflows of any size, from small scripts to large-scale enterprise pipelines.  
- âœ… **Monitoring and Logging** â€“ Provides detailed logging, failure handling, and retry mechanisms.  
- âœ… **Extensibility** â€“ Supports custom plugins, operators, and hooks for integrating with various services.  
- âœ… **UI Dashboard** â€“ Allows users to track, manage, and visualize DAG executions.  

##### Why Use Apache Airflow?  
- ðŸ”¹ Automates repetitive data tasks.  
- ðŸ”¹ Handles dependencies between tasks (ensures tasks execute in the right order).  
- ðŸ”¹ Provides built-in error handling and alerting.  
- ðŸ”¹ Supports integrations with cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure.

#### 2. Core Concepts in Apache Airflow  

| **Term**  | **Description**  |
|-----------|----------------|
| **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**  | A collection of tasks that run in a specific sequence.  |
| **Task**  | A single unit of work in a DAG, such as running a script or querying a database.  |
| **Operator**  | A predefined template for executing a task (e.g., PythonOperator, BashOperator).  |
| **Scheduler**  | Determines when tasks should be executed based on defined intervals or triggers.  |
| **Executor**  | The component that actually runs the tasks (e.g., LocalExecutor, CeleryExecutor).  |
| **Hooks**  | Used to connect Airflow to external services (e.g., databases, APIs, cloud storage).  |
