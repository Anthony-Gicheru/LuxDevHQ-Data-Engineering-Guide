1. Introduction
Overview of the role of data engineers in the data lifecycle.
Key differences between data engineering and data analytics.
2. What Is Data Engineering?
Definition: The discipline of designing and building systems for collecting, storing, and analyzing data at scale.
Core Concepts:
Data pipelines.
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
Data warehouses and data lakes.
Scalability and reliability.
3. Importance of Data Engineering
Enabling analytics and machine learning through robust infrastructure.
Streamlining access to clean, consistent data.
Real-world applications:
Powering recommendation systems.
Supporting real-time analytics in e-commerce and finance.
4. Tools for Data Engineering and Their Functions
Data Storage:

Relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
Cloud storage solutions (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
Data Processing:

Batch processing tools (e.g., Apache Spark, Hadoop).
Streaming tools (e.g., Kafka, Flink).
Workflow Orchestration:

Airflow, Prefect.
ETL Tools:

Informatica, Talend, dbt (data build tool).
Programming Languages:

Python, Scala, SQL.
5. Practical Case Study
Design and build a simple data pipeline:
Example: Ingesting data from an API, storing it in a database, and transforming it for reporting.
