### Project: Setting Up Cloud Storage and Connecting a Database with DBeaver

#### Objective:
The goal of this project is to set up a cloud storage service (AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage), create a PostgreSQL database, and connect to it using DBeaver for managing and querying the data. This project will help you understand how to configure cloud storage, set up a relational database, and use a SQL client to interact with the database.

---

### Steps to Complete the Project:

#### 1. Set Up Cloud Storage (AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage)

**Using AWS S3:**
- Create an AWS account (if you don’t have one).
- Go to the **S3 dashboard** and create a new **S3 bucket**.
  - Set a unique bucket name and choose a region.
  - Leave default settings for now.
- Upload a sample file (e.g., a CSV file or any dataset) to your S3 bucket.

**OR**

**Using Azure Blob Storage:**
- Create an Azure account (if you don’t have one).
- Go to the **Azure Portal** and create a **Storage Account**.
  - Choose the appropriate region and resource group.
  - Once created, navigate to the Blob Storage section and create a **container**.
- Upload a sample file (e.g., a CSV file) to your Azure Blob Storage.

#### 2. Set Up PostgreSQL Database

- Install PostgreSQL locally on your machine or use a cloud database provider like AWS RDS or Azure PostgreSQL.
  - For local installation:
    - **Windows**: Download the installer from the official PostgreSQL website.
    - **Mac**: Use Homebrew (`brew install postgresql`).
    - **Linux**: Use the package manager (`sudo apt-get install postgresql`).
  
- Create a PostgreSQL database named `test_db` (or any other name).
  - Connect to the database using the `psql` terminal.
  - Create a simple table to store data (e.g., a table for storing basic product information):
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE products (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(100),
        price DECIMAL
    );
    ```

#### 3. Install and Configure DBeaver

- Download and install **DBeaver** (a SQL client tool that connects to databases).
  - Go to [DBeaver website](https://dbeaver.io/) and download the version compatible with your operating system.
  
- Open DBeaver and create a **new connection** to the PostgreSQL database:
  - Select **PostgreSQL** as the database type.
  - Enter the database connection details (host, port, username, password, and database name).
    - For local PostgreSQL installation, the default values are typically:
      - Host: `localhost`
      - Port: `5432`
      - Username: `postgres`
      - Password: Your PostgreSQL password
      - Database: `test_db`

#### 4. Connect Cloud Storage with PostgreSQL

- **(Optional) For AWS S3**: Use a tool like `boto3` (AWS SDK for Python) to interact with the files stored in your S3 bucket. You could upload a CSV file and load it into your PostgreSQL database using Python.
  - Example Python code using `boto3` to download a file from S3:
    ```python
    import boto3
    
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'
    file_key = 'your-file.csv'
    local_file_path = '/path/to/save/file.csv'
    
    s3.download_file(bucket_name, file_key, local_file_path)
    ```

- **(Optional) For Azure Blob Storage**: Use the `azure-storage-blob` Python library to interact with Azure Blob Storage.
  - Example Python code to download a file from Azure Blob Storage:
    ```python
    from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient, BlobClient, ContainerClient
    
    connection_string = "your_connection_string"
    container_name = "your_container_name"
    blob_name = "your-file.csv"
    download_path = "/path/to/save/file.csv"
    
    blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(connection_string)
    container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client(container_name)
    blob_client = container_client.get_blob_client(blob_name)
    
    with open(download_path, "wb") as download_file:
        download_file.write(blob_client.download_blob().readall())
    ```

#### 5. Use DBeaver to Interact with PostgreSQL

- Open **DBeaver** and connect to your **PostgreSQL database**.
- Execute basic SQL queries such as:
  - Inserting data:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('Laptop', 1000);
    ```
  - Querying the data:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM products;
    ```
- You can now use DBeaver to perform other SQL operations like creating new tables, updating data, etc.

#### 6. (Optional) Data Import from CSV

If you’ve uploaded a CSV file to your cloud storage (S3 or Azure Blob), you can use DBeaver to import this file into your PostgreSQL database:
  - In DBeaver, right-click on the table where you want to import data and select **Import Data**.
  - Choose the CSV file from your local machine (after downloading from cloud storage).
  - Map the CSV columns to the corresponding table columns.

### Deliverables:
1. Screenshots of the cloud storage (AWS S3 or Azure Blob) with uploaded files.
2. PostgreSQL database schema (SQL script) for the `products` table.
3. A Python script for interacting with the cloud storage and PostgreSQL database (if applicable).
4. DBeaver connection details and queries performed on the database.
5. A brief report documenting the steps taken and any challenges faced.

### Skills Gained:
- Configuring cloud storage (AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage).  
- Setting up and connecting to a PostgreSQL database.  
- Using DBeaver as a SQL client for managing and querying data.  
- Integrating cloud storage with PostgreSQL (optional, but adds a real-world dimension).

This is a simple and effective project that will help learners get hands-on experience with cloud services, databases, and SQL client tools while reinforcing key data engineering concepts.
